# Possible Analyses

## Missing Data

We need to make a decision about how to handle the different types of missingness, and that will depend on the algorithm used. The problem is that values for some variables will be missing because they were not relevant to the child, parent, or non-parental caregiver interviewed.  In some cases, we can use indicator variables (present / absent). We can also have different classifiers for subsets of the data that have coherent variables. 

## Using Scales 

The document ff\_scales9.pdf contains the formal scales that were administered during interview. These items can be summarised using the specifications in the file to yield a single, meaningful number.
