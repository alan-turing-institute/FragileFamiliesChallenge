This is the Alan Turing Institute Team's second submission.

We first select continuous variabels as defined in the meta data, impute the nans, remove constant columns, which result in 1771 variables.
Then we did PCA, keeping only the top 50 priciple components.
Similar to the first submission, we built multi-variable linear regression and logistic regression to predict the six outcomes.
