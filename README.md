### Wild west ðŸ¤ 

We have no protected branches here and every contributor has write access. This allows us to work more quickly but it also leaves open the possibility of screwing up other people's work.

Please consder using branches for your work and submitting pull requests for review *even though* you don't technically have to.

Alternatively, just be careful.

But most of all, have fun :smile:
